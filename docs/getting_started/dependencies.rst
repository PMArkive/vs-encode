vs-encode depends on the following third-party scripts:

* -

The following VapourSynth libraries are also required for full functionality:

* `dgdecode <https://www.rationalqm.us/dgmpgdec/dgmpgdec.html>`_
* `dgdecodenv <https://www.rationalqm.us/dgdecnv/binaries/>`_
* `L-SMASH-Works <https://github.com/AkarinVS/L-SMASH-Works>`_
* `vapoursynth-scxvid <https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-scxvid>`_
* `VapourSynth-wwxd <https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-wwxd>`_
* `vs-imwri <https://github.com/vapoursynth/vs-imwri>`_

This list is non-exhaustive, as dependencies may have their own dependencies.
An attempt has been made to document major dependencies on a per-function basis.
Unfortunately, \*func family modules have complex dependency graphs and documenting
them is beyond the scope of this module.

.. You can install most of these dependencies by running vs-encode directly:

.. .. code-block:: console

..     python -m vs-encode
..         Install/update vs-encode dependencies? [y/n]:

.. | Note that this does **not** install every single dependency!
.. | Just the ones that are easy to obtain through package managers!
